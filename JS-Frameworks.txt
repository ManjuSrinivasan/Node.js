# JAVASCRIPT FRAMEWORKS 

Among the many benefits of JavaScript, one is its support for a wide variety of programming styles, 
including object-oriented, functional, event-driven and prototype-based programming.
JS frameworks are another great thing about JavaScript. 
They are now being used by everyone to access and use pre-written JavaScript code for standard features and functionalities.

# What Is A JavaScript Framework?

A JavaScript framework is a collection of pre-written JS code libraries that developers can access 
and use for creating routine programming functions and features.
The basic use of a JS framework is for building websites and web applications with ease.
Rather than writing the same code from scratch, developers can utilize these code libraries for accessing these programming blocks.
For instance, if you want to add a standard JavaScript gallery to your webpage, you can find the code for the same in any JS framework 
and use it on your page.
This obviously saves you a lot of time which you can spend on creating other unique elements of your website.

# Why Is It Useful?

By providing an extensive library of ready to use plugins and code blocks, JavaScript saves your time and energy.
When you’re working with a JavaScript framework, you can simply search for a functionality in the JS libraries 
and directly import its code into your site’s code as required.
The benefit of using a JS framework over a jQuery library is the overall efficiency of the former.
The framework ensures that the new code perfectly fits the existing code of your site and is neatly structured.
Besides that, it provides ready-made solutions for a number of common JS coding problems.
